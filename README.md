## Installation

1. Clone the repo and 
2. Run npm start in your node CLI.


## Usage 

This Employee Directory was designed to organize a large data set. The information is stored on a Web Api but is brought to the browser by way of an axios call. It features a button that will sort employees alphabetically and an input field that filters by name upon pressing `enter`.  It was also designed to meet the criteria for GT Full-stack Flex program homework requirements. 

It is built using React components and customized based on acceptance criteria provided in class.
